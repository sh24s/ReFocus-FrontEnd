              <p>
                The average person loses over 2 hours per day to digital distractions. We're constantly 
                juggling notifications, social media, and an endless stream of information. This constant 
                distraction is eroding our ability to focus, think deeply, and accomplish meaningful work.
              </p>
              <p>
                Students struggle to concentrate on their studies. Young professionals find it hard to 
                deliver their best work. Even coaches and mentors need tools to help their mentees develop 
                focus skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                ReFocus was born from this realization: we need a platform that doesn't just help us 
                track time, but actually coaches us towards better focus habits.
